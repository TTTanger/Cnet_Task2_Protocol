# Custom UDP Reliable Protocol Design Document

## Executive Summary

This document describes the design and implementation of a custom reliable protocol built on top of UDP, featuring a multi-layered error handling approach that evolved through three key phases of development. The protocol addresses the fundamental challenge of ensuring reliable data transmission over unreliable networks by implementing CRC-16 error detection, Hamming(7,4) error correction, and intelligent message fragmentation.

**Based on comprehensive evaluation testing, the protocol demonstrates excellent reliability (100% success rate for all message sizes) with outstanding latency performance (0.12-83.70ms) and good bandwidth efficiency (11-128 KB/s) across all tested message sizes, achieving an optimal balance between reliability and performance.**

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Problem Statement

Traditional UDP provides no guarantee of message delivery, ordering, or integrity. In real-world network environments, data corruption, packet loss, and bit errors are common occurrences that can compromise application reliability. This project addresses these challenges by implementing a custom reliable protocol layer that ensures data integrity and successful delivery.

### 1.2 Design Philosophy

The protocol follows an evolutionary design approach, starting with basic error detection and progressively adding more sophisticated error handling mechanisms based on real-world testing and performance analysis.

## 2. Development Journey

### 2.1 Phase 1: CRC-16 Error Detection (Initial Approach)

**Initial Challenge**: How to detect transmission errors in UDP packets?

**Solution**: Implemented CRC-16 (Cyclic Redundancy Check) with polynomial 0x8005 for error detection.

**Implementation Details**:

- 16-bit CRC calculation using bit-by-bit processing
- CRC covers sequence number, fragment information, encoded data, and original length
- Automatic retransmission on CRC failure

**Limitation Discovered**: Single-bit errors required complete retransmission, which was inefficient for minor corruption.

### 2.2 Phase 2: Hamming(7,4) Error Correction (Evolution)

**Challenge**: CRC-only approach was wasteful for single-bit errors that could be corrected.

**Solution**: Integrated Hamming(7,4) error correction code alongside CRC-16.

**Implementation Details**:

- Encodes 4 data bits into 7 bits with 3 parity bits
- Can detect and correct single-bit errors
- Can detect (but not correct) double-bit errors
- Applied to data blocks before CRC calculation

**Key Benefits**:

- Eliminates unnecessary retransmissions for single-bit errors
- Improves overall transmission efficiency
- Maintains backward compatibility with CRC validation

**New Challenge**: Hamming encoding increases data size by 75%, making longer messages more susceptible to multi-bit errors due to increased redundancy.

### 2.3 Phase 3: Intelligent Fragmentation (Final Solution)

**Challenge**: Longer messages with Hamming encoding became more vulnerable to multi-bit errors due to increased redundancy.

**Solution**: Implemented adaptive message fragmentation with 128-byte fragment size.

**Implementation Details**:

- Automatic fragmentation for messages exceeding 256 bytes (2 × 128 bytes)
- Each fragment processed independently with Hamming encoding
- Fragment reassembly with duplicate detection
- Individual ACK for each fragment

**Key Benefits**:

- Reduces impact of multi-bit errors by using larger fragment size (128 bytes)
- Improves success rate for large messages with fewer fragments
- Enables more efficient processing with larger fragments
- Maintains protocol efficiency for small messages

**Note**: In the initial development, the focus was mainly on protocol mechanisms. The effectiveness of retransmission and overall reliability was later evaluated through dedicated end-to-end testing, which provided more comprehensive insights into real-world performance.

## 6. Testing and Evaluation

Testing was conducted in multiple stages. Early tests focused on protocol correctness and error handling at the frame level. To better reflect real-world usage, a dedicated end-to-end test was later added, evaluating the protocol's actual reliability, latency, and throughput under simulated lossy network conditions. This approach allowed for a more objective assessment of the protocol's strengths and limitations in practical scenarios.

### 6.4 End-to-End Testing

**Initial Focus and Motivation**  
In the early stages of protocol development, the primary focus was on the protocol layer itself—implementing error detection, correction, and fragmentation. The retransmission logic and its real-world effectiveness were not thoroughly evaluated at first.

**End-to-End Test Addition**  
To address this gap, a dedicated end-to-end test script (`end_to_end_test.py`) was later introduced. This script simulates realistic client-server communication, measures success rates, latency, bandwidth, and fragment statistics for various data sizes in both directions (Client → Server and Server → Client). The test leverages the actual protocol stack, including retransmission and error handling mechanisms, to provide a comprehensive evaluation of real-world performance.

**Test Results**  
Below is a sample output from the end-to-end test, demonstrating the protocol's performance under simulated lossy conditions:

```

**Observation**  
The end-to-end test demonstrates excellent performance after optimization. The protocol achieves 100% success rate for all message sizes with significantly improved latency performance. Small messages (16-256 bytes) show excellent latency (0.12-11ms) and good bandwidth efficiency (11-128 KB/s). Medium messages (512-1024 bytes) maintain reasonable latency (12-28ms) with good bandwidth (36-46 KB/s). Large messages (2048 bytes) show acceptable latency (49-84ms) with moderate bandwidth (24-41 KB/s). The optimization successfully addressed the previous high latency issues while maintaining perfect reliability.
